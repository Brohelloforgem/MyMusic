    <h1>MyMusic</h1>
    <h3>The best Discord.JS music selfbot.</h3>
</div>

<br>
<h2 align="center">Setup</h2>

1. Clone the repository from Git and CD into the folder.
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`.
3. Customize `config.js` with the configuration.
   - The prefix & token are obvious.
   - You can allow specific IDs, or `*` for everyone.
   - You can also block specific people. This blocklist will override `*` on allow.
4. If you want to customize what the bot says, see `strings.js`. It's already set up if you don't want to bother it.
5. Run `npm start` to start the bot!
